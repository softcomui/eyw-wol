La Victoria Lab is comprised of a group of designers, anthropologists, architects, and entrepreneurs working on improving the lives of the Peruvian middle class. Founded in 2014, it’s part of Intercorp, an economic group of more than 30 companies spanning banks, malls, cinemas, schools, and more. 

It’s owned by one of Peru’s most successful entrepreneurs, Carlos Rodríguez-Pastor, and in total these companies employ 56,000 people and account for a staggering 2.5% percent of the gross domestic product.

Rodríguez-Pastor and Intercorp’s destinies are intertwined with those of Peruvians. 

Peru is one of South America’s fastest growing economies, with a healthy 6 percent year-on-year growth from 2002 to 2013, on average. That rising economic tide, along with government policy, has created extraordinary social mobility: Between 2005 and 2013, poverty was halved. In 2013 alone, nearly half a million rose out of poverty, of a population of 30.8 million.

### Just another nice heading
As Peruvians’ lives have improved, so the new middle class's needs and aspirations have changed: They’re entrepreneurial, expect great services, and want the best for their children. That challenge and opportunity led Rodríguez-Pastor to enlist IDEO to bring our empathic approach to the construction of a new school system, Innova, from the ground up, and to redesign their retail banking at Interbank.

Success there bred an ambition. Intercorp, Rodríguez-Pastor realized, needed to build two capabilities: a deep, bedrock understanding of the new middle class, and an innovation capability with which his companies could create new products, services, and experiences. “I want a little IDEO,” Rodriguez-Pastor said, and the germ of La Victoria Lab took root.

### Solutions and Skills
Powered by those insights, La Victoria Lab has brought human-centered problem-solving to a variety of Intercorp’s companies, including new retail ventures, and improving the cinema-going and banking experience.

In 2015, the Lab began scaling its efforts to build innovation capabilities across all of the portfolio companies by using IDEO’s innovation readiness assessment, Creative Difference. Each company received a report of their strengths and improvement areas, and as a result, the Lab facilitated workshops and community groups focused on building essential capabilities.

"Creative Difference is the first tool that has allowed my team and the organization to have a precise picture of where we are in the spectrum of doing truly innovative work. Now, we can identify our strengths and areas of improvement, we can develop work plans and actions based on data,  and can start to really dig deep into innovation,” says Aurelia Alvarado, director of innovation, Innova Schools.
