The ideal candidate is driven to keep up with the latest techniques in web design and development, and has an eye for differentiating between design fads and worthwhile trends. You are equally comfortable working autonomously or collaborating with a team. 
    
    When you look at an innovative website, you immediately open the inspector. You are a rare blend of creative and technical. No detail escapes you. You are ready to join a team building impactful, award-winning websites for a world renowned publishing platform.
    
    Our team spawns new projects from both hypotheses and creative initiatives. We use data-driven strategy, iteration, and play to craft an experience worthy of the customers we attract. Our own Developer Platform powers the elegant, performant sites that serve as the entry point for millions of our potential customers. Examples include www.squarespace.com, realtalk.squarespace.com, and dreamingwithjeff.com. 
    
    Our cadence is fast, and our ideas are bold. This agile team has the freedom and drive to perpetually prototype and integrate new technologies, such as React, WebGL, and Machine Learning. You’ll work side by side with world-class designers and engineers to deliver the best work of your career.

    ### Responsibilities
    * Create and optimize our impactful websites, including squarespace.com
    * Develop new projects with our creative team, helping people learn about Squarespace
    * Build new prototypes to push the boundaries of our developer platform

    ### Qualifications
    * You've built several outstanding websites from concept to launch
    * Are highly proficient in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
    * Familiar with the latest web techniques and libraries (React, etc.) and understand their opportunities and tradeoffs.
    * An eye for interaction, motion, and graphic design. You relish in finishing touches.
    * Strong working knowledge of responsive web design and cross-platform compatible coding techniques and troubleshooting
    * Animation or motion design skills, a plus (e.g. PIXI.js, WebGL)
